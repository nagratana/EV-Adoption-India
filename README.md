⚡ Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption & Charging Stations Analysis

📌 Project Overview  
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are growing rapidly in India, but **charging infrastructure** is not expanding at the same pace.  
This project explores **EV sales trends** (2020–2023) and **charging station (CS) distribution** across states, using **Excel for data preparation** and **Tableau for data visualization**.  

The goal is to deliver **business insights** about adoption patterns and infrastructure availability, helping policymakers, businesses, and researchers understand the EV landscape in India.

🚀 Key Features & Insights  
- ✅ **State-wise EV Sales** analysis (2020–2023)  
- ✅ **Charging Stations sanctioned** across states  
- ✅ **Average distance between charging stations** → availability metric  
- ✅ **Top 5 states** by EV sales and charging infrastructure  
- ✅ Interactive **Tableau Dashboard** with filters (Year, State) for comparison

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Excel** → Data Cleaning & Pre-processing  
- **Tableau** → Dashboard & Interactive Visualizations  

 📈 Business Insights  
- **Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat** are leading in both EV adoption and charging infrastructure.  
- Many states still show **range anxiety** due to fewer charging stations → higher average distance between CS.  
- EV sales have shown **rapid growth post-2021**, signaling a positive adoption trend.  

🔍 How to Use  
1. Open the [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/EVsales_17557950930660/Dashboard1).  
2. Apply filters to explore **yearly adoption** and **state-wise infrastructure**.  
3. Compare trends between **sales growth** and **charging infra support**.
